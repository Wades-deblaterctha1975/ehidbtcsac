just walked out of phule and wow. my brain's still spinning like tht carousel scene in the middle. why was tht even there? So much noise in the theater. Some kid behind me dropped popcorn and it rolled down like mini tumbleweeds... anyway, the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, right? it's a whirl of color and chaos — that opening shot, just bam, hits you like a cat in a hat on a skateboard.

the guy next to me was loudly chewing, like tectonic plates grinding away. speaks to the background noise in my head — all the clatter and THUMP of scenes where Phule’s stuck in spirals of his own thoughts. i remember the blue, overwhelming, like if oceans had speeches to make. somehow soothing and jarring at the same time.

> Why sitcom lighting for a drama? or maybe it’s just me. it’s almost like remembering a dream with music that doesn’t fit, and yet, feels like it makes total sense. like phule climbing up the big hill, every step a drumbeat, echoing, reverberating through the plot, if there was one. sorta like when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 and it’s a totally different file, some parallel universe 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮making...

i can’t even with that final scene. the one hwere phule just sits, staring at his reflection, eyes like mothballs ready to combust. it lingers, kinda how your mind holds onto a single jigsaw piece of a puzzle you never choose to complete.

someone mentioned wanting to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   later and trust me, it’s like peering through a kaleidoscope of broken ideas, and yet, can't shake off this weird contentedness a bit like eating cereal with a fork — doesn’t do the job, but there’s a satisfaction in the incompleteness.

is this even making sense? blistered fingers from typing, back's aching from that weird theater seat. the story of phule dances on my thoughts like those neon signs you can't ignore. keep thinking, was the dog actually a metaphor or just a dog? absurdity’s kingdom, the theater of noise.
